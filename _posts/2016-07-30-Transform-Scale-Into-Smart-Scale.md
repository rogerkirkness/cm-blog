title: How We Transform Scales Into Smart Scales
---

One of the first questions that come up when we are talking to food processors is how we can transform their existing scales into smart scales without requiring them to purchase a new scale or indicator.

We define a smart scale kind of like the definition of a smartphone: the same functionality as the original device, with the addition of the ability to connect to the internet for additional functionality.

A smart scale in the context of a food processing facility means a scale that is connected to the internet so that the data from the scale can be used to label cases, track production and lot trace products later on.

Many existing hardware providers offer solutions that provide this functionality but the data often lives on the plant floor device itself and cannot be access remotely, including from the office. This can make it difficult to meaningfully analyze your production data.

#### How It Works

In order to get the data from the scale into Catchmate, we use [an adapter device](https://www.startech.com/Networking-IO/Serial-over-IP/1-port-RS232-serial-over-ip-adapter~NETRS2321P) that takes the input from the scale (if it is serial format like USB or RS232) and converts it to TCP/IP, the technology that underlies the internet.

Once we have that data in the system, the user can easily generate, preview and print GS1-128 barcode labels for the case of product. This is in contrast to hardware-centric solutions that do not allow print preview.

Print preview of all labels leaving your facility is critical as over 75% of food industry recalls are caused by mis-labelling and not food safety.

If your scale is already TCP/IP enabled (it was purchased in the last few years and/or has a network adapter) then you do not need to buy an adapter to get the data from your scale into Catchmate. You already have a smart scale!

Our mission is to liberate the data on the plant floor to help you get better, faster information about what is happening in production. This can help with production, traceability and inventory.

If your data is stuck on plant floor hardware that make it hard to get reports on what is happening in production, [we can help](https://catchmate.ca/#solution).
