Catchmate recently got involved in the Answer Box program at Foodstarter. Foodstarter is a business incubator for food processing companies located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Answer Box is a service that they offer to members of their organization that provides pro bono and paid access to food industry experts for questions, advise and other services.

Catchmate founder Roger Kirkness joined Answer Box as an expert to help new food processing companies get a better understanding of plant floor technology used in the food processing industry.

We plan to expand our work with Foodstarter in the near future to offer extended trial offers to Foodstarter members. For now we will continue to offer our expertise to the many members of Foodstarter.
