title: Introducing Catchmate
---

Our mission is to make weighing, labelling and tracking food products on the plant floor as easy as possible for our customers. We started Catchmate because we saw that independent food processors needed an inexpensive, easy-to-use solution for weighing, labelling and tracing products.

This blog will discuss various regulations, technologies, threats and opportunities relevant to our customers.

The key things Catchmate seeks to address are:

- Weighing products on any existing plant floor scale without new hardware
- No hardware vendor lock-in - buy new scales from any vendor you wish
- Flexible deployment options - cloud, hybrid or on-site software deployment
- Access from any device on the plant floor, in the office or remotely

We already have a few customers piloting Catchmate with more soon to come onboard. To see Catchmate in action, [request a demo](mailto:hello@catchmate.ca?Subject=Catchmate%20Demo) or learn more about [our solutions](https://catchmate.ca/#solution).
