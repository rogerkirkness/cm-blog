title: Introducing Catchmate
---

Our mission is to make weighing, labelling and tracking food products on the plant floor as easy as possible.

We started Catchmate because we saw that there was an opportunity to provide smaller food processors with an inexpensive, easy-to-use solution for weighing and labelling your products.

We started this blog to discuss various regulation, technology, threats and opportunities relating to the plant floor. We seek to be the food production manager's best source of industry news.

This would prevent our customers from having to make a risky investment in outdated software from companies that specialize in hardware.

Catchmate can be connected to any of your existing plant floor scale, making your scales (and plant floor) smarter.

The key things Catchmate seeks to address that are not currently well served are:
* Weighing products on any existing plant floor scale without buying new hardware
* No requirement for hardware vendor lock-in - you can buy new scales from anyone
* Flexible deployment options - cloud, hybrid or on-site software deployment
* Access from any device on the plant floor, in the office and mobile

We already have a few customers piloting Catchmate with more soon to come onboard. To see Catchmate in action, [request a demo](mailto:hello@catchmate.ca?Subject=Catchmate%20Demo).
