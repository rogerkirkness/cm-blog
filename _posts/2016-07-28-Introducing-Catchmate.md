title: Introducing Catchmate
---

Our mission is to make weighing, labelling and tracking food products on the plant floor as easy as possible.

We started Catchmate because we saw that there was an opportunity to provide smaller food processors with an inexpensive, easy-to-use solution for weighing, labelling and tracing your products.

Catchmate exists to provide a superior alternative to proprietary hardware vendor plant floor software. This blog will discuss various regulations, technologies, threats and opportunities relevant to our customers.

Catchmate can be connected to any of your existing plant floor scale, making your scales (and plant floor) smarter. The key things Catchmate seeks to address that are not currently well served are:

- Weighing products on any existing plant floor scale without buying new hardware
- No requirement for hardware vendor lock-in - you can buy new scales from anyone
- Flexible deployment options - cloud, hybrid or on-site software deployment
- Access from any device on the plant floor, in the office and mobile

We already have a few customers piloting Catchmate with more soon to come onboard. To see Catchmate in action, [request a demo](mailto:hello@catchmate.ca?Subject=Catchmate%20Demo) or learn more about [our solutions](https://catchmate.ca/#solution).
