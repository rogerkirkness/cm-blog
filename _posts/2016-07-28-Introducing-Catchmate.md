title: Introducing Catchmate
---

Our mission is to make weighing, labelling and tracking food products on the plant floor as easy as possible.

We started Catchmate because we saw that there was an opportunity to provide smaller food processors with an inexpensive, easy-to-use solution for weighing and labelling your products.

This would prevent our customers from having to make a risky investment in software from hardware specialists.
