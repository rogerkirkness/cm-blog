title: New Feature Multi Item Cases
---
Catchmate has been invested heavily in R&D lately as a result of several new customer projects. We just launched another new feature in production systems called multi item cases.

Typically Catchmate has been used for weighing and labeling cases that are comprised of one item. Generally this allows you to label your case with information about the contents and create a GS1 supply chain barcode for the contents. 

Multi item cases allows you to create a mixed case, or a case with different item codes in it. It has an interface that lets you record the weight of each item as you put it in the case. And then it allows you to label your case with a list of the contents, including the item code, description, weight, price and best before date. 

This will be an extremely useful tool for companies that need to fill cases with multiple items, each with a weight that varies. We always appreciate your thoughts and feedback and would love to hear what you think of multi item case packing at [feedback@catchmate.ca](mailto:feedback@catchmate.ca?Subject=Multi-Item-Case-Packing).
