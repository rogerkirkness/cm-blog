title: IRRC Institute and Cornerstone Capital Group Future of Food Safety Report
---

IRRC Institute and Cornerstone Capital Group recently released a report about food safety and traceability practices at 60 publicly traded food companies.

The report discusses various critical components of the future implications of food safety as it relates to these large companies.

For Catchmate customers, these companies often represent either competition or customers (sometimes both) and the largest companies tend to dictate the standards around food safety and traceability.

The report appears to be available to everyone on the IRRC website, which you can find [here](http://irrcinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Cornerstone_IRRC-Future-of-Food-Safety-July-2016.FINAL-REPORT.pdf).
