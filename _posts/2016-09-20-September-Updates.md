title: September 2016 Updates
---

Catchmate recently updated our production app running at [https://app.catchmate.ca](https://app.catchmate.ca) with some new functionality:

- Added button to remove existing company logo or plant logo
- Added support for custom batch numbers in traceability report
- Improved print layout and user control over print margins
- Updated barcode engine to increase resolution and control of barcode characteristics
- Improved support for multiple users in a single company
- Various other minor bug fixes and performance enhancements

We also updated our production database with the following functionality: 

- Multi-node replica set (simplified: we have multiple copies of user data on different servers to prevent data loss)
- High availability with automatic failover (simplified: we have a back-up running in case the main one fails, the back-up automatically takes over)
- Op log tailing and performance analytics (simplified: we can see how fast your updates are and tweak things to make them faster)

Catchmate is a plant floor solution that evolves with your continuously changing needs of the food processors we serve. Any further updates that occur in September will be added here. 

If you have comments or suggestions about these updates or other functionality in the Catchmate system - we want to hear from you. Email: [thoughts@catchmate.ca](mailto:thoughts@catchmate.ca)
