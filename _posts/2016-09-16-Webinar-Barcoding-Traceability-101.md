---

Catchmate and Minotaur Software will be partnering to present an upcomming webinar to members of Food & Beverage Ontario. To sign up, email webinar@catchmate.ca or call +1 (650) 263-1867. 

Title: Barcoding 101 and How To Automate Traceability – Webinar
Date: September 27th at 12PM EST
Presented by: Judith Kirkness (Minotaur Software), Roger Kirkness (Catchmate)

All attendees receive a copy of Judith’s book The Traceability Factor: Increase Profits Through Tracking.

Supply chain traceability is coming and it won’t be on paper. All of the major retailers and food service distributors in Ontario want some kind of GFSI (global food safety initiative) approved food safety audit certification in order to sell your products through their stores and distribution facilities. If you sell to the US or plan to, FSMA requires that foreign suppliers implement electronic traceability systems, so the need to upgrade software is top of mind for many companies.
