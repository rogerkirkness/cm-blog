title: New Feature: Price Lists
---
Catchmate recently launched a new feature in all production customer systems called price lists. 

- Price lists can be used to generate item and customer specific pricing on your labels
- You can setup as many price lists as you want
- You can set a default price list so that if there is no customer price list the system will fallback to default pricing
- You can assign price lists by customers so a customer or group of customers can get special pricing
- Prices can appear anywhere on any label format
- Prices are automatically calculated depending on the net weight, customer and item in a batch

Please let us know what you think of the new functionality: [feedback@catchmate.ca](mailto:feedback@catchmate.ca).
