title: Disassembly Food Production Costing
---

My original discussion of costing gave an introduction to costing raw materials as they come into inventory as the different methods that can be used to differentiate the cost of your items depending on what information is available and how your business works.

Several members of the food industry (meat, produce) pointed out that in their line of business, disassembly costing is required. Disassembly costing is more challenging than assembly costing because you have to decide how to allocate costs in a way that is less determinate. In this article I’ll discuss several methods of disassembly costing and how you can calculate them.

Disassembly costing is something you do when you want to determine what costs are flowing on a disassembly production process, such as cutting up meat or produce into parts. In assembly, you use addition, because you start with several parts and make up one whole (totalling the combined costs as well as the costs which occur to make the transformation).

During disassembly, you have to decide whether to apportion costs on the basis of the sale price of the components or by using a factor. Neither methods are ‘perfect’ or ‘correct’, this is for your own internal analysis. I’ll discuss the two major types (several more exist for unique circumstances in our system, eleven types on my last count) here and hope it contributes enough insight to help you develop or adapt your own method of disassembly costing.


#### Sale Price-based Proportioning

When to use it:

Sale price-based proportioning is when you use the ultimate sale price of an output (ie. Steaks vs. ribs) to allocate costs. This results in a consistent margin percentage across your products, because high value items are apportioned higher cost and low value items are apportioned low cost. The total input costs (the cost allocated to the raw material) still equals the total output cost (the total cost among all the various outputs) but it’s allocated in a way that makes the margin appear consistent between SKUs.

This is often used by our customers when they want consistent margins to appear on profitability reports and it's also a good way to look at costs as being something which is subordinate to the value you can get by selling something, as it can help to illustrate how you should disassembly your products for optimal sales and margin.

How it works:

Input material –12 Pineapples

Total materials cost – $20

Sale value for output items:

- Pineapple Juice 1L (Retail: $4)

- 12 Pineapple Cores (Retail: $3/each)

- Core, skin and top (Retail: $0 – waste)

Total sale value: $40

Sale: Cost ratio – $40/$20 = 2:1

Cost allocation for output items:

- Pineapple Juice 1L (Cost: $2)

- 12 Pineapple Cores (Cost: $1.50/each)

- Core, skin and top (Cost: $0)


#### Factor-based Proportioning

When to use it:

According to The Traceability Factor, the second most common method for disassembly costing is a factor-based proportioning method. This method is more complex to calculate manually but if you automate it, it can be a more accurate way of apportioning costs to your outputs. Each input is allocated a numbered factor. This method is the most flexible as it allows you to decide what costs to allocate to each of your outputs without anchoring to sale price. It doesn't reflect (as well) how to disassemble a product, but it's advantage is in it's flexibility as you can use it to allocate costs however you think makes the most sense.

How it works:

Input Material – 12 Pineapples (12 LB)

Total materials cost – $20

Factor allocations for output items:

- Fine pineapple chunks (Factor: 2)

- Large pineapple chunks (Factor: 1.5)

- Full pineapples, cored (Factor: 1)

Expected costs based on factor (cost/lb x factor)

- Fine pineapple chunks (Cost/lb: $3.33)

- Large pineapple chunks (Cost/lb: $2.50)

- Full pineapples, cored (Cost/lb: $1.67)

Actual output item weights:

- Fine pineapple chunks (Weight: 3LB)

- Large pineapple chunks (Weight: 4LB)

- Full pineapples, cored (Weight: 5LB)

Cost of each output using factors (factor cost x actual weight)

- Fine pineapple chunks (Cost: $10.00)

- Large pineapple chunks (Cost: $10.00)

- Full pineapples, cored (Cost: $8.30)

Cost ratio (output item factor cost / total output cost)

- Fine pineapple chunks (Ratio: 35.3%)

- Large pineapple chunks (Ratio: 35.3%)

- Full pineapples, cored (Ratio: 29.4%)

Final output cost (total cost x cost ratio)

- Fine pineapple chunks (Cost: $7.06)

- Large pineapple chunks (Cost: $7.06)

- Full pineapples, cored (Cost: $5.88)


#### Summary

The decision of which disassembly costing method to use in your meat or produce business ultimately lies with those who have to use it to make decisions. We’ve found the two methods discussed in this article are useful for analyzing many situations that might occur in these industries, but there are always exceptions which require unique costing methods to be applied. We’ve developed software tools to make calculating this information much easier but you could use Excel, paper or another business analysis software to achieve similar results, with variable amounts of efforts involved in calculating it.

A good rule of thumb is that allocating based on the sale price is beneficial if you want to maintain consistent margin during customer invoicing (since each will have an evenly split allocation based on the sale price, each will achieve the same margin percentage). Using a factor based method however is useful when the input costs are the most important lever in the business, because you can change the factors around to suit your product mix. This is common in meat, which drives popularity of the factor-based costing method.

In future posts I’ll talk about how to add additional costs to your materials and finished goods such as freight, duty, brokerage, labour, utilities and more.
