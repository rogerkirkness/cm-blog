title: Learn 4 Food Processing Costing Methods
---

#### Introduction

The food processing industry is extremely competitive. Because consumers can easily substitute one company's products for another, food processors often have market pressure to reduce pricing in order to compete with each other. Combined with steady inflation in the input costs of raw food materials, this squeezes the margins of food processors.

We find that food processors understand surprisingly little about which products and customers are generating their margin dollars (useful for optimizing a low margin business). Often when tracking inventory manually (paper, Excel), you are unable to keep up with the frequency that your inventory valuation is updated. This often causes food processors to resign to understanding cost of goods sold periodically instead of in real time (ie. accounting calculations at month end) due to the overwhelming burden of updating costs.

Our work involves automating the inventory tracking process, from receiving, through production and on to the customer. Through this work we've developed a number of ways by which our customers keep track of the costs of their products. Our technology makes this tracking possible, but it's my hope that regardless of what tools you might use this article will provide you with some ideas on improving your ability to understand your product costs.

#### The methods

We offer four major assembly costing methods within the Minotaur system (a total of eighteen possible options are available actually, although several are used only during disassembly or in highly unique businesses). The variation usually reflects the requirements of a certain sector of the food industry and the ability of the company to track product costs (some are easier to track than others -- not everyone can attain the more complex methods).

Which methods our customers use ultimately tends towards the preference of those responsible for producing the financials (ie. outside accounting firm or inside controller) and those who own the business. There is generally no right/correct/perfect way to cost products for internal management purposes (there is in financial accounting but that's primarily for outside purposes). The four major assembly costing models our customers use are:

#### 1. Standard Costing

How it works:

Sugar usually costs us $1.00/lb

Therefore, the standard cost is $1.00/lb

A shipment came in today at $1.20/lb

Therefore, the cost variance is 20% or $0.20/lb

When to use it:

A standard cost is a cost set based on an expectation of the cost of a product, and then analysis is performed later on by managers which compares the standard (expected) cost with the actual cost incurred during purchasing or production. All the cost variation between expectation and actual results are posted to a "variance account" which is ultimately reconciled into the total cost of goods sold for that period. This is what many large/complex manufacturing business use to determine product costs, but it's not really the optimal method, especially in the food industry where input costs vary materially.

The downside of the standard costing method is that the costs that are tracked in between accounting periods don't actually reflect the cost of the product, but rather the expectation of the cost of the product. This makes ongoing management of these costs difficult, because the truth only comes out at the end of the period, at which time you could opt to update the standard cost. This method is very common but we provide our customers with methods of tracking costs which use the actual cost of the product instead of trying to predict them.

#### 2. Average Costing (by Item)

How it works:

We purchased 5LB of sugar for $1.00/lb

We then purchase 5LB more sugar for $2.00/lb

The cost is calculated as $5.00 + $10.00 / 10lb

The average cost of the sugar in our inventory is $1.50/lb

When to use it:

This is the average 'rolling' cost of a particular item. This is the most common costing method used by our customers and we recommend it in most situations except those which are better served by one of the other methods below. The first receipt of an item sets the cost, and then each subsequent delivery is averaged into the cost that currently exists in your inventory, regardless of the lot number.

This gives you a realistic picture at any given time as to what the cost of your inventory is, so you can extrapolate in determining sale prices. In a company with a single facility and variance in the price of an input by lot (sometimes the price is higher, sometimes it's lower) this provides the optimal information for management to make pricing decisions.

#### 3. Actual Costing (by Lot)

How it works:

We purchased 5LB of sugar (lot 123) at $1.00/lb

Then we purchased 5LB of sugar (lot 123) at $2.00/lb

We now purchase 10LB of sugar (lot 456) at $1.75/lb

The current inventory is therefore:

Sugar (lot 123) - 10LB - $1.50/lb

Sugar (lot 456) - 10LB - $1.75/lb

When to use it:

This is one of the most 'accurate' methods of costing your products. Every time you sell a product or use a raw material in production that's costed this way, the exact cost of the lot you used is posted to your accounting (such as $1.50/lb for one lb of sugar (lot 123)). The downside is that your profitability calculations on a production run or invoice will be all over the place, since you might sell one customer one lot and a different one to another customer, and it will affect how profitable each account appears.

In production, it would cause you to wonder if there are production issues due to cost overruns one day and to prematurely congratulate people the next day, even though the variance could be due to the fluctuation of the input costs rather than the quality of the work being done by the production team. One other issue to consider is that those who are paid commission based on the gross margin they achieve won't like the arbitrary fluctuation in their commissions. This is useful if your costs don't vary much and you want as accurate a picture as possible of the profitability of specific deals/batches vs. the business as a whole.

#### 4. Average Costing (by Location)

How it works:

Warehouse A receives sugar at $1.00/lb

Warehouse A ships Warehouse B one lb of sugar, adding $0.20 in freight charges.

Sugar in Warehouse A has a cost of $1.00/lb

Sugar in Warehouse B has a cost of $1.20/lb

When to use it:

In a situation where you have multiple distribution facilities, it can be advantageous to be able to add costs that are specific to that facility to the cost of the product, in order to truly understand the profitability of your sales through that facility. For example, if all your products are produced in one location, and then shipped to various distribution centres around the country, it's likely that some of the centres will require more shipping/freight charges than others, in order to get the product there.

Including these costs in your products allows you to understand your true margin without having to split out each location's accounting on it's own. This is only necessary if you have multiple locations, in which case it's often what people will use for costing once they get to a level that they're consistently adding shipping and handling charges to their products.

Conclusion

Identifying which costing methods is the optimal one for your business can be challenging, and it depends on whether you have multiple locations, how much variation there is in your input costs and whether you're easily able to average the costs of your products together. In a future article I'll discuss some of the more uncommon methods of costing, such as those which are used for disassembly of goods. It can be interesting to use different costing methods before settling on one, as each provides information from a unique perspective.
