title: New Feature Nutrition Facts
---
Catchmate recently implemented another new feature called nutritition facts. Complying with Health Canada (Canadian-market) and FDA (US-market) regulations for nutritition facts labeling can be complex and often requires ordering labels from a third-party company. Catchmate will offer nutrition facts printing in our production SaaS system and on-site systems moving forward.

Catchmate nutrition facts labeling offers:
- US-market Food Safety Modernization Act compliant nutrition facts labels (FSMA)
- Canadian-market Safe Food for Canadians Act compliant nutrition facts labels (SFCA - still pending)
- Easy setup and use of nutrition facts labels that comply with both markets
- Ongoing support for updated nutrition facts labels (such as SFCA support)
- Automatic calculations of daily recommended intake percentages
- Total compliance with strict FDA layout requirements

Catchmate is going to start by offering nutrition facts labels on an as requested basis, because the layout of the label will be affected and some label elements may need to be moved around in order for it to work with your existing label format and barcode printers. This service will be included in your existing subscription and/or maintenance agreement. 

If you have ideas for new Catchmate functionality, we plant to continue investing heavily in R&D through the end of the year. Email ideas@catchmate.ca with your recommendations.
