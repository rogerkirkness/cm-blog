title: New Feature 2D GS1 Barcodes
---
Catchmate recently revised our core labeling format to support two dimensional GS1 barcodes. This is the same data from your existing labels, encoded in a space saving 2d format. 

This will enable Catchmate users to add nutrition facts labels to your case labels without requiring a larger label format or other elements to be excluded. The 2d format supports 2000+ characters of data as opposed to the existing linear format supporting only 48. Most handheld scanners support this format (but not all yet) so if you have scanning issues we can revert you to the 1D format.
